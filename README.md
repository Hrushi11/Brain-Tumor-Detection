# Brain-Tumor-Detection

Image Segmentation model that predicts if a person has brain tumor with localizing the tumor on the original image. The Model uses an Unet architecture.
The dataset used for the project is available here - [Brain MRI Segmentation](https://www.kaggle.com/mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation)
